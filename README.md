Snapmaker Luban is an easy-to-use 3-in-1 software tailor-made for Snapmaker machines.
You can customize the printer settings and control the machine using the command panel in Luban anytime with ease.
The software also provides G-code generation support for 3D models, laser engraving / cutting, and CNC milling.

Our goal is to provide a multi-functional 3D software, while making it as accessible and customizable as possible for new users / beginners.

The software is inspired by [cncjs](https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs) by cheton, we also use [CuraEngine](https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine) for 3D slicing.

    ```Bash
    > sudo apt update
    ```

- Install `Git`.

    ```Bash
    > sudo apt install git
    ```

- Install Node.js 12. You can use [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and manage multiple Node.js versions:

    ```Bash
    > nvm install 12
    > nvm use 12
    ```

- Install dependencies for Linux builds and compilation environment for third-party dependencies.

    ```Bash
    > sudo apt install rpm
    > sudo apt install make g++ libfontconfig-dev
    ```

### CentOS

- Update software sources.

    ```Bash
    > sudo yum update
    ```

- Install `Git`.

    ```Bash
    > sudo yum install git

    > nvm use 12
    ```

- Install dependencies for Linux builds and compilation environment for third-party dependencies.

    ```Bash
    > sudo yum install rpm-build
    > sudo yum install make gcc-c++ freetype-devel fontconfig-devel
    ```

### Windows 10

- Install `Git` from https://git-scm.com/.
- Install Node.js 12 from https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/.
- Install node-gyp compilation environment for the third-party denpendencies.
  - **Official:** You can follow [node-gyp installation instructions](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows).
  - **Alternative:** Open `Git Bash` as administrator and follow the steps below. This will take about half an hour.

    ```Bash
    > npm install -g windows-build-tools
    > npm config set msvs_version 2017
    ```
    
    or

    ```Bash
    > npm config set @xiekun1992:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com/
    > npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=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
    > npm install -g @xiekun1992/windows-build-tools@5.2.3
    > npm config set msvs_version 2017
    ```

    **Note**: By now the latest version of `windows-build-tools` is v5.2.2, which has an issue of Visual Studio Build Tools in endless wait loop. In order to save your time, we fixed the bug and provide the second way.
