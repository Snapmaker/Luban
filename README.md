Snapmaker Luban is an easy-to-use 3-in-1 software tailor-made for Snapmaker machines.
You can customize the printer settings and control the machine using the command panel in Luban anytime with ease.
The software also provides G-code generation support for 3D models, laser engraving / cutting, and CNC milling.

Our goal is to provide a multi-functional 3D software, while making it as accessible and customizable as possible for new users / beginners.

The software is inspired by [cncjs](https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs) by cheton, we also use [CuraEngine](https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine) for 3D slicing.
