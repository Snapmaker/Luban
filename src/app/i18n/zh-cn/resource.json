For the 200mW Laser Engraving Module, the Z Offset can be set by judging the size of the laser dot by eyes with low power. However, for the 1600mW Laser Cutting Module, this method is less accurate as the laser dot is too strong and less interpretable. To set the Z Offset more accurately, we can move the module to the position that is close to the optimal Z Offset (Offset A). The software will test the results from a few positions next to Offset A on the same material. The best result determines the best Z Offset.": "设置工作原点本质上是为了在X和Y方向上找到雕刻图像的最佳点，同时确定雕刻和切割平台与激光膜组间的距离（Z偏移）以找到最小的激光点来最大限度地利用激光的功率并获得最佳效果。对于200mW激光雕刻模块，Z偏移可通过低功率下目测激光点的大小来设置。但是对于1600mW的激光切割模块，由于激光点过于明亮，用肉眼难以测定，因此该方法并不准确。为了更准确地设置Z偏移，我们可以把模块移动到接近最优Z偏移的位置（偏移A）。软件将有序的选取靠近偏移A的几个点来测试雕刻效果。能雕刻出最佳效果的位置确定为最佳Z偏移。",
