    "Setting work origin is essentially finding the best place for the engraved image in the X and Y directions and determining the distance (Z Offset) between the Engraving & Carving Platform and the Laser Module to acquire the smallest laser dot on the material for the most efficient use of the laser power and the best result. For the 200mW Laser Engraving Module, the Z Offset can be set by judging the size of the laser dot by eyes with low power. However, for the 1600mW Laser Cutting Module, this method is less accurate as the laser dot is too strong and less interpretable. To set the Z Offset more accurately, we can move the module to the position that is close to the optimal Z Offset (Offset A). The software will test the results from a few positions next to Offset A on the same material. The best result determines the best Z Offset.": "设置工作原点本质上是为了在X和Y方向上找到雕刻图像的最佳点，同时确定雕刻和切割平台与激光膜组间的距离（Z偏移）以找到最小的激光点来最大限度地利用激光的功率并获得最佳效果。对于200mW激光雕刻模块，Z偏移可通过低功率下目测激光点的大小来设置。但是对于1600mW的激光切割模块，由于激光点过于明亮，用肉眼难以测定，因此该方法并不准确。为了更准确地设置Z偏移，我们可以把模块移动到接近最优Z偏移的位置（偏移A）。软件将有序的选取靠近偏移A的几个点来测试雕刻效果。能雕刻出最佳效果的位置确定为最佳Z偏移。",

    "Set Work Speed and Power based on the material you are using. If you are using a piece of 1.5 mm wood sheet, it’s recommended to set the Work Speed to a value between 80 mm/s and 120 mm/s and set the Power to 100%.": "依据使用的材料设置工作速度和功率。如果使用的是一张1.5mm木薄板，建议将工作速度的数值设置在80mm/s到120mm/s之间，功率设置为100%。",
    "Choose the position that can cut the material the most smoothly or engrave the thinnest line and the software will set it as Z Offset. In this example, -2.0 should be the Z Offset.": "根据雕刻结果，在软件上选择切割效果最好或雕刻的线最薄的位置，软件会将此位置对应的偏移量设置为Z偏移。此例中，Z偏移为-2.0。",
