    "Setting work origin is essentially finding the best place for the engraved image in the X and Y directions and determining the distance (Z Offset) between the Engraving & Carving Platform and the Laser Module to acquire the smallest laser dot on the material for the most efficient use of the laser power and the best result. For the 200mW Laser Engraving Module, the Z Offset can be set by judging the size of the laser dot by eyes with low power. However, for the 1600mW Laser Cutting Module, this method is less accurate as the laser dot is too strong and less interpretable. To set the Z Offset more accurately, we can move the module to the position that is close to the optimal Z Offset (Offset A). The software will test the results from a few positions next to Offset A on the same material.

For the 200mW Laser Engraving Module, the Z Offset can be set by judging the size of the laser dot by eyes with low power. However, for the 1600mW Laser Cutting Module, this method is less accurate as the laser dot is too strong and less interpretable. To set the Z Offset more accurately, we can move the module to the position that is close to the optimal Z Offset (Offset A). The software will test the results from a few positions next to Offset A on the same material. The best result determines the best Z Offset.",
