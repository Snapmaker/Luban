For the 200mW laser module, the Z Offset can be set by judging the size of the laser dot by eyes with low power. However, for the 1600mW laser module, this method is less accurate as the laser dot is too strong and less interpretable. To set the Z Offset more accurately, we can move the module to the position that is close to the optimal Z Offset (Offset A). The software will test the results from a few positions next to Offset A on the same material. The best result determines the best Z Offset.": "<0>设置工作原点</0>是为了在 X 和 Y 方向上找到最佳雕刻位置，并确定雕刻和切割平台与激光模组间的 Z 轴距离，以找到最小光斑来实现最佳雕刻效果。对于 200mW 激光模组，Z 偏移可通过目测光斑大小来设置。而对于 1600mW 激光模组，由于激光点过于明亮，肉眼难以判定，目测光斑并不准确。为了准确地设置 Z 偏移，将激光模组移动到接近最优 Z 偏移的位置（偏移A）。软件将选取靠近偏移 A 的几个点来测试雕刻效果，雕刻出最佳效果的位置即为最佳 Z 偏移。",
