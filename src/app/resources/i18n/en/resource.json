For the 200mW laser module, the Z Offset can be set by judging the size of the laser dot by eyes with low power. However, for the 1600mW laser module, this method is less accurate as the laser dot is too strong and less interpretable. To set the Z Offset more accurately, we can move the module to the position that is close to the optimal Z Offset (Offset A). The software will test the results from a few positions next to Offset A on the same material. The best result determines the best Z Offset.",
